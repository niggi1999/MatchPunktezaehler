    A class to create an Interface to a "SmartRemote Consumer Control" device

        device (evdev.InputDevice): The connected Device, None if no device is connected.
        __observers (List): The observers for the number of connected devices.
        loop (AbstractEventLoop): The running event loop.

    Methods:

        findDevice(): Searches connected devices for "SmartRemote Consumer Control" and puts it in self.device
        readBluetooth(): Waits for events from the device and returns the pressed button
        attach(observer): Attaches a new Observer.
        remove(observer): Removes a Observer.
